# Concode
> Code together.

Concode makes finding collaborators and contributors for your projects or ideas a snap! Sometimes you have an ambitious concept you want to realize but you don't have all the skills you need to make it happen. That's where we come in. Just use our intuitive search to find someone with exactly the skills you're looking for, connect with them, and get working on your dream!

## Getting started

We're still in the planning stages, but this will probably be as simple as making an account with your GitHub login and searching the site.

## Features

With Concode, you can find collaborators or find projects to contribute to easily.
* Search by skills needed
* Filter projects and contributors by location
* See project details right away

## Licensing
This project will eventually be released under an open source license, but we have to decide which one.
